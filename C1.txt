Project Choice:
  1.1 Homology based gene finder


C1 Questions:
  1. Download the Scenedesmus genomic sequence provided. How large is the available data-set?

    # of sequences = 18029
    # of base pairs = 111749585
    size of file =  109 MB


  2. Download the Chlamydomonas Proteome. How large is the data-set? How many sequences?

    # of sequences = 15935
    # of amino acids = 10838366
    size of file = 11 MB


  3. Blast each Chlamy protein against the Scendesmus genome. What version of Blast will you use?
     How many queries get at least one hit (C1)? 
     
    If we are querying our chalmy protein sequences against a database of DNA in the form of the
    scenedesmus genome, we should use tblastn which, according to the Blast website, "searches
    translated nucleotide databases using a protein query." However, after 8 hours of using tblastn
    with the Chlamy proteome being blasted against the Scenedesmus dimorphus genome, it was still
    running. If any changes occur, I will be sure to note them here.
